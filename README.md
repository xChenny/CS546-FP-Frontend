# CodeJS Editor Frontend

CodeJS is an online code editor and file storage platform geared towards programmers! We created this project as a Final project in the Web development class we are a part of.

CodeJS utilizes the following technologies:

- **AWS S3**: File storage
- **NodeJS**: Backend
- **MongoDB**: Store User Data for Authentication
- **ReactJS**: Frontend, in conjunction with Redux
- ... and many, many, other npm packages
